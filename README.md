# BioBonds - DeFi Meets Preventive Health

![BioBonds Logo](./public/biobonds-logo.png)

## Overview

BioBonds is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that connects investors with preventive healthcare initiatives through blockchain-powered impact bonds. The platform enables investors to fund critical preventive health programs while earning returns based on verified health outcomes.

### Problem

Preventive health programs (e.g., diabetes screening, cancer tests, vaccines) are chronically underfunded because they don't generate immediate ROI. Governments and insurers often can't justify frontloading these costsâ€”yet downstream savings (from avoided hospitalizations) are massive. There's no efficient way for private capital to finance upstream health outcomes and earn returns based on verifiable results.

### Solution: Health Impact Bonds on XRPL

BioBonds let investors fund preventive care (e.g., $10 for a screening) and earn tokenized returns only if the health outcome is met. These are programmable financial instruments:

1. Investors stake XRP into a smart contract (escrow)
2. Funds are released to healthcare providers only after a verified outcome is achieved
3. Investors earn impact yield (subsidized by insurers or NGOs)
4. All transactions and outcomes are publicly auditable and pseudonymous

## Technical Architecture

BioBonds leverages the XRP Ledger (XRPL) for secure, fast, and low-cost transactions:

- **XRPL Escrow**: Guarantees outcome-based disbursement
- **Wallet Integration**: Secure connection to XRPL wallets for investment transactions
- **Time-based Escrow**: Funds are locked until specific conditions are met
- **Transaction Verification**: All investments can be verified on the XRPL explorer
- **DID Verifiable Credentials**: Health outcomes are verified using XRPL's native DID credential system

## XRPL DID Verifiable Credentials

BioBonds uses XRPL's Decentralized Identifier (DID) system to create and verify health outcome credentials:

### How It Works

1. **Credential Issuance**: Healthcare providers issue verifiable credentials on the XRPL when health outcomes are achieved
2. **Credential Verification**: Investors can verify these credentials on-chain before funds are released
3. **Escrow Release**: Once credentials are verified, escrow funds can be released to healthcare providers

### Key Components

- **CredentialIssuer**: React component for healthcare providers to issue verifiable credentials
- **CredentialVerifier**: React component for investors to verify health outcome credentials
- **EscrowReleaseModal**: Component for releasing escrow funds based on verified credentials

### Technical Implementation

- Credentials are stored as `CredentialSet` transactions on the XRPL
- Each credential contains:
  - Issuer (healthcare provider's XRPL address)
  - Subject (patient's XRPL address)
  - Credential Type (e.g., "HealthOutcome")
  - Outcome Data (description, value, date, etc.)
  - Expiration Date
- Verification checks the XRPL ledger for valid credentials using the `ledger_entry` API
- All credential transactions can be viewed in the XRPL explorer

### Demo Flow

1. Connect a wallet using the WalletConnection component
2. Invest in a health bond (creates an XRPL escrow transaction)
3. Issue a health outcome credential (as a healthcare provider)
4. Verify the credential (as an investor)
5. Release the escrow funds based on the verified credential

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- PNPM package manager
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/biobonds.git
   cd biobonds
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

### Building for Production

```bash
pnpm build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Using the Application

### 1. Connect Your Wallet

- Click on "Connect Wallet" in the top navigation bar
- For testing purposes, you can create a test wallet that will be funded with XRP from the XRPL testnet
- You can specify a funding amount (up to 100 XRP, though the testnet typically provides 10 XRP)
- Your wallet address and balance will be displayed once connected

### 2. Browse Available Health Bonds

- The dashboard displays a list of available health bonds
- Each bond shows:
  - Health initiative title and description
  - Target funding amount and current progress
  - Expected yield rate
  - Provider information
  - Health outcomes to be achieved

### 3. Invest in a Bond

- Click on a bond card to view detailed information
- Click "Invest" to open the investment modal
- Enter your desired investment amount (must be less than your wallet balance)
- Confirm the transaction to create an escrow on the XRPL testnet
- The transaction will be processed and you'll receive a confirmation with a transaction hash
- You can view your transaction on the XRPL explorer by clicking the provided link

### 4. Monitor Your Investments

- Your active investments are displayed in the "My Investments" section
- You can track the progress of each bond and see when outcomes are verified
- When health outcomes are achieved, your returns will be calculated and displayed

## Testing on XRPL Testnet

This application runs on the XRPL testnet, which means:

- No real money is at risk
- Test wallets are funded with test XRP from the XRPL testnet faucet
- Transactions are real but occur on the testnet blockchain
- Escrow transactions are time-based with:
  - FinishAfter: 1 minute (for demo purposes)
  - CancelAfter: 30 days

## Technical Details

- **Frontend**: React with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Radix UI components
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state
- **Blockchain Integration**: XRPL JavaScript SDK (xrpl.js)
- **Wallet Management**: Custom wallet connection and management
- **Transaction Handling**: Real XRPL escrow transactions with proper signing and submission
